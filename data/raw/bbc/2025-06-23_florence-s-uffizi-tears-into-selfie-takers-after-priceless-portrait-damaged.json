The painting will be repaired in the interim so it is ready to go back on display.The exhibition will then run, as originally planned, until 28 November.Earlier this year at Palazzo Maffei, in Verona, a man seemingly slipped and fell on to a bejewelled chair by Italian artist Nicola Bolla.He had been taking photos with a woman, pretending to sit on the chair. Museum director Vanessa Carlon said: \"Sometimes we lose our brains to take a picture, and we don't think about the consequences.\"Of course it was an accident, but these two people left without speaking to us - that isn't an accident.\"ArtFlorence"
