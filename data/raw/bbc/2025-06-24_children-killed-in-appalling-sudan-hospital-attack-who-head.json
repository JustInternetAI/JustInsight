Dozens of other people were injured too, it added.Crucially, the hospital ran a dialysis unit and focused on the care of civilians as opposed to soldiers, according to the Emergency Lawyers group, which documents abuses by both the RSF and the army.Both the Sudan Doctors Network and the Emergency Lawyers group say the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) were to blame for the attack on Saturday.But the doctors' body says the reason for the attack was that the army was trying to   kill RSF fighters \"stationed inside\" al-Mujlad Hospital. The RSF has not commented on that claim, nor has the army.On Monday, the head of the UN children's agency, Unicef, warned of a \"worsening crisis\" for children caused by Sudan's civil war and said the aid response lacked two-thirds of the funding needed.Visiting refugees in neighbouring Chad, Catherine Russell said \"hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable children are bearing the brunt of both the war in Sudan and a lack of essential services for those who have fled to Chad\".Many children are \"malnourished, out of school, and at serious risk of exploitation and disease\", she added.Among the most harrowing accounts to come out of Sudan's war is the evidence that armed men are raping and sexually assaulting children as young as one. Some children have tried to end their own lives as a result.More BBC stories on Sudan:'We took this photo, fearing it would be our last'Sudan in danger of self-destructing as conflict and famine reignUS says Sudan used chemical weapons in war as it issues new sanctions'They ransacked my home and left my town in ruins'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSudanAfrica"
